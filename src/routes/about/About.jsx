          Uganda has made enormous progress in reducing poverty, yet one in
          three rural people still live below the poverty line. This factsheet
          outlines IFAD’s strategy to reduce poverty in Uganda while improving
          their food security and reducing their vulnerability. It also outlines
          ongoing operations in the country.

          Livestock contribute to the farming operations of more than 800
          million poor smallholders. Rural households can improve their
          livelihoods by raising a wide variety of animals: cows, buffaloes,
          sheep, goats, pigs, poultry, camels, llamas, alpacas, horses, donkeys,
          rabbits and even bees. It is estimated that the demand for livestock
          products will more than double over the next 20 years, due to
          urbanization, economic growth and a change in consumption patterns in
          developing countries. Livestock is one of the fastest growing
          agricultural subsectors in developing countries, accounting for about
          30 per cent of agricultural GDP. About 78 per cent of the world’s poor
          people live in rural areas and rely largely on agricultural work to
          put food on their plates and make a living. Smallholder farmers will
          need to become more productive, efficient and environmentally
          sustainable to meet the requirements of growing market demand, largely
          from urban areas. These requirements relate to food quality, food
          safety and consistency of supply. A game changer for rural families
